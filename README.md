This project was created to help people access quick local weather data. The application requires the user to input a city and country in order to receive their local weather information. That's it!

This is version 2 of a project I built a couple yeas ago. This updated version is built using React.js ðŸ˜€ and the first version was built with jquery ðŸ˜·.
